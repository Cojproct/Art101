function myFunction(param1, param2) {
 // Making macaroni & cheese roux style:
//Mise en place (everything in its place)
//Make sure you have all the ingredients ready (milk, butter, macaroni boxes, salt, and cheese powder)
//All cookware is clean and ready for use, and easily accessible
//Boil water
//Add salt
//Add the macaroni
//Keep the water at a boil until the macaroni is ready
//Turn the sink water on to cold and let it run down the drain during this next step
//Pour the macaroni into a strainer to remove the water
//Put butter in the pot and let it melt
//Add cheese powder (remember to fold the packets up over the pot after it is emptied to create less mess)
//Carefully pour milk into the pot, little bits at a time
//Mix the butter, milk, and cheese powder until it reaches desired consistency. Repeat step 10 as necessary to reach this consistency
//That creates the roux. Add the macaroni to the roux and stir from the bottom to coat the macaroni in the cheese roux
//Serve and enjoy

  // Pseudocode for Rock, Paper, Scissors:
//Get all the variables: Computer choice, Player choice, and result
//Assign each choice a number 1= rock, 2= paper, 3=scissors 
//Have player choose 1, 2, or 3
//Have computer generate random number 1-3
//To determine the winner:
	//1. If the player’s choice is the same as the computers choice then the result is a tie. 
	//2. If the player’s choice is 3 (scissors) and the computers choice is 2 (paper) the result is player wins.
	//3. If player choice is 2 (paper) and the computers choice is 1 (rock) then the result is player wins 
	//4. If the player choice is 1 (rock) and the computer choice is 3 (scissors)the result is player wins 
	//5. If any other combination occurs, the result is that the computer wins
//print results
