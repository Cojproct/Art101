			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocode and problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p. With your partner, pseudocode an everyday task and a simple game</p.>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> We didn't really run into many problems, breaking down the game into pseudocode was strange for me because you think of it like muscle memory but when you are challegened into breaking it down it harder than I thought it would be  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I believe I put a good effort into this lab, I got help from chat GPT for breaking down the game into numerical values for the code. I also think my partner deserves credit for doing such an awesome job. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<pre><code>
						// Making macaroni & cheese roux style:
						//Mise en place (everything in its place)
						//Make sure you have all the ingredients ready (milk, butter, macaroni boxes, salt, and cheese powder)
						//All cookware is clean and ready for use, and easily accessible
						//Boil water
						//Add salt
						//Add the macaroni
						//Keep the water at a boil until the macaroni is ready
						//Turn the sink water on to cold and let it run down the drain during this next step
						//Pour the macaroni into a strainer to remove the water
						//Put butter in the pot and let it melt
						//Add cheese powder (remember to fold the packets up over the pot after it is emptied to create less mess)
						//Carefully pour milk into the pot, little bits at a time
						//Mix the butter, milk, and cheese powder until it reaches desired consistency. Repeat step 10 as necessary to reach this consistency
						//That creates the roux. Add the macaroni to the roux and stir from the bottom to coat the macaroni in the cheese roux
						//Serve and enjoy
					
						// Pseudocode for Rock, Paper, Scissors:
						//Get all the variables: Computer choice, Player choice, and result
						//Assign each choice a number 1= rock, 2= paper, 3=scissors 
						//Have player choose 1, 2, or 3
						//Have computer generate random number 1-3
						//To determine the winner:
							//1. If the player’s choice is the same as the computers choice then the result is a tie. 
							//2. If the player’s choice is 3 (scissors) and the computers choice is 2 (paper) the result is player wins.
							//3. If player choice is 2 (paper) and the computers choice is 1 (rock) then the result is player wins 
							//4. If the player choice is 1 (rock) and the computer choice is 3 (scissors)the result is player wins 
							//5. If any other combination occurs, the result is that the computer wins
						//print results
