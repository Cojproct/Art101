			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with a partner, further create a local file structure on your computer, add index.html files, and upload to the server.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem that arose for me was my image wasnt showing up when I tested it in my browser and the only thing that would show up was a tiny box that sid invalid photo. I then realized that I had extra code in my intial linking to the photo that wasnt needed so I had to delete that section and the photo finally showed up.   </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I really enjoyed this lab I felt like it wrapped a lot of previous knowledge and labs into one and it organized my home page and links really well. I put a lot of energy into this lab..</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I was able to write out this tab for my website pretty easily and I would say that I can add a little more flare and style to the page.</p>
