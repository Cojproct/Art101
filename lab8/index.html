			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I had a hard time getting my javascript to appear on the page when I would open it in default but I entered the javascript console and would find the errors line by line. this especially worked well by problem solving the bonus task. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I spent a lot of time making sure that the javascript consol worked and that it looked like the example shown on the lab 8 assignment page. I believe it turned out looking good and I attemped to do the bonus task. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Go to console to see the outline!</p>
